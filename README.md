# Station Project 2: A Classification Challenge

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at predicting whether a candidate will be accepted for an interview based on several factors such as age, business travel, education, marital status, and more. The dataset contains various features, and we will use three classification models to make predictions: **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

### Key Features:
- **AI-powered job evaluation systems**: These systems help evaluate candidates based on their skills, aptitude, personality, and cultural fit.
- **Models used**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors.
- **Purpose**: Improve hiring decisions by predicting interview acceptance.
